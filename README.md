# Web-Scraping-Data - Vietnamese Real Estate Data Scraper

This project is a Python-based tool developed to scrape data from the Vietnamese real estate website [nhadat24h.net](https://nhadat24h.net/). It is part of a challenge to develop a semantic search engine for real estate properties in Vietnam.

## Description

The goal of this project is to scrape relevant data from the nhadat24h.net website, which will serve as one of the data sources for the semantic search engine. The Python script provided in this project automates the scraping process, extracts information such as property details, prices, areas, and timestamps, and saves the data in a CSV file. Additionally, it downloads and stores the associated images in a separate "images" directory.

## Project Files

The project consists of the following files:

- `scraping_script.py`: The Python script that performs web scraping and saves the scraped data and images.
- `images/`: The directory that stores the downloaded property images.
- `scraped_data.csv`: The CSV file containing the scraped data.

To use this tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
